# MA-MIDN

Deep learning approaches have demonstrated significant progress in breast cancer histopathological image diagnosis. However, training an interpretative diagnosis model using high-resolution histopathological image is challenging. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel multi-view attention-guided multiple instance detection network (**MA-MIDN**). We first divide each histopathology image into instances and form a corresponding bag to fully utilize high-resolution information through multiple instance learning (MIL). Then a new multiple-view attention (MVA) algorithm is proposed to learn diverse attention on the instances. A MVA-based MIL pooling strategy is designed for aggregating instance-level features to obtain bag-level features. The proposed MA-MIDN model performs lesion localization and image classification, simultaneously. Particularly, we train the MA-MIDN model under the deep mutual learning (DML) schema. This transfers DML to a weakly supervised learning problem.The proposed method achieves better localization results without compromising classification accuracy.
